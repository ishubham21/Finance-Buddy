### Description of Problem

Remember the time when you got your first salary and wasted it because you did not know how to invest/save it wisely?

Parents consciously don’t expose money matters in front of their children all because they think this is not something children should get involved with. This results in poor financial literacy and thus, equally poor financial decisions in young adults. It is time to break this particular mould.

Inclusion of mindful financial literacy right from childhood is pivotal for children to learn the basics of financial management early on - from the time they learn to manage money given by their parents, spend it wisely, and figure out how they can save some of it. 

Money is an essential commodity, and it is important to master personal money management from teenage itself to achieve financial literacy. Parents must add one more step in their constant planning for their kids and inculcate financial intelligence in them before they venture out into the world independently.
